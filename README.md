| Subject |  Engineering | 
| Specific subject area |  The dataset consists of WiFi packets of probe requests type, which have been captured in controlled environment|
| Type of data  | WiFi probe requests saved as PCAP files |   
| How data were acquired   | Data was acquired via a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 with an additional WiFi interface supporting monitor mode (chipset Atheros AR927) and an interface for cellular connection (SIM7000ENB-IoT HAT). <br> The software program used is TShark v. 3.4.10  |   
| Description of data collection  | After setting up the environment (e.g., removing all Wi-Fi devices except the Raspberry and the device to be analysed). We started the capture script and saves the output on PCAP files |
